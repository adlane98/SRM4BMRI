    """Extracts patches of any n-dimensional array in place using strides.
    Given an n-dimensional array it will return a 2n-dimensional array with
    the first n dimensions indexing patch position and the last n indexing
    the patch content.
    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : 3darray
        3-dimensional array of which patches are to be extracted
    patch_shape : integer or tuple of length arr.ndim
        Indicates the shape of the patches to be extracted. If an
        integer is given, the shape will be a hypercube of
        sidelength given by its value.
    extraction_step : integer or tuple of length arr.ndim
        Indicates step size at which extraction shall be performed.
        If integer is given, then the step is uniform in all dimensions.
    Returns
    -------
    patches : strided ndarray
        2n-dimensional array indexing patches on first n dimensions and
        containing patches on the last n dimensions. These dimensions
        are fake, but this way no data is copied. A simple reshape invokes
        a copying operation to obtain a list of patches:
